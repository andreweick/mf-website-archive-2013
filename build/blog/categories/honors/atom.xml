    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Institute for Modern Intelligence (IMI) announced  today that Dr. Suzanne Yoakum-Stover, IMI Executive Director, was named  as one of the top 5 information managers of the year by Information  Management Magazine.</p>

<p>Dr. Yoakum-Stover was recognized for her work creating a practical,  Ultra-Large Scale (ULS) systems solution – a unified dataspace - for  data storage, exploration, enrichment, and exploitation that  accommodates the diversity of data, semantics, and perspectives without  information loss or distortion. Through an innovation that provides a  generic interface to all data, she aims to enable all manner of processing to be put into production coherently within an internet-scale dataspace. Building upon this foundation her mission is to execute a  broad ULS systems research agenda with specific application to  intelligence and ultimately inaugurate what she terms “the new  discipline of Modern Intelligence” - the science and practice of  intelligence at Ultra-Large Scale.  “I was absolutely delighted to be identified as one of the top  information managers of the year. It is an honor that reflects the community’s recognition and growing acceptance of the IMI’s breakthrough  approach for addressing the scale and diversity of data storage,  processing, visualization, and management all within a unified, yet  completely open dataspace.” - Dr. Yoakum-Stover.</p>
