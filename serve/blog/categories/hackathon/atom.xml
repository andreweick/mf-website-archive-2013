    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mission Focus is a sponsor for <a href="http://reinventtransit.com/">Reinvent Transit</a>, a gathering and “hackathon” that brings together technologists, makers, and creative problem solvers to better all forms of transportation in Baltimore. The event will run from Friday April 5th through Sunday April 7th at Betamore, the recently-opened urban campus for technology and entrepreneurship located in Federal Hill.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, groups of software developers, designers, and citizens will be taking ideas that have been crowdsourced from the local community and building applications and prototypes that help solve some transportation-related problems and address the needs of Baltimore’s bus riders, cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians. After hearing about transit experiences from a panel of speakers on Friday evening, participants will form teams on Saturday morning and will work collaboratively over the next 24 hours on their solutions. By Sunday evening, they’ll compete to win prizes by presenting a demo of what they’ve built to a distinguished panel ranging from city transit officials to venture capitalists. While technology will be a likely tool used over the weekend, creative non-technical solutions are also of interest.</p>
